Identify the narrowest acceptance check (explicit command, local verifier, or targeted test) and run it to get a concrete failure signal.\n\nBias toward a working first draft over perfect design: implement the smallest safe fix, rerun the same check, and iterate. Keep diffs tight; avoid refactors and new dependencies unless required by the contract.\n\nMatch the contract literally (paths, ports, output formats, permissions/executability, non-interactive behavior, and any stated constraints like allowed libraries or \"do not modify\" inputs). Never mask failures (skipped checks, unconditional success output, \"|| true\", broad catch/ignore, or weakening tests just to go green).\n\nIf verifiers/tests are not available, do not stall; create a minimal self-check that mirrors the acceptance criteria (remove it unless it belongs in the permanent suite).\n\nBefore committing to expensive steps (long builds/services/downloads), get a cheap proof of viability (smoke build, quick run, reachability, minimal example). Before finishing, rerun the acceptance check end-to-end and briefly report what changed and what commands you ran.";
