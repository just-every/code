You have exceeded the maximum number of tokens. Please write a concise context checkpoint for the next agent:

**Progress So Far**
- Summarize completed work, partial implementations, and the current state of open threads.
- Mention any deviations from the original goal or in-flight experiments.

**Key Context & Constraints**
- List active todos with file paths and line numbers when possible.
- Flag code that still needs tests (edge cases, integration, performance) or manual verification.
- Record blockers, open bugs, environment quirks, or dependencies that influenced recent decisions.

**Next Concrete Steps**
- Prioritize the immediate task(s) the next agent should tackle first.
- Describe any setup, context, or reasoning they should revisit before coding.
- Call out decisions that still need confirmation.

Keep the tone factual and actionable. The goal is to let the next agent resume quickly without rereading the entire history.
