## Aggregate Results

### Unanimous Answer Rate

| SPEC | Total Ambiguities | Unanimous | Rate |
|------|-------------------|-----------|------|
| 010  | 5                 | 2         | 40%  |
| 025  | 5                 | 1         | 20%  |
| 035  | 4                 | 2         | 50%  |

| **Total** | **20** | **9** | **45%** |

**Average unanimous answer rate: 45%**

Not the 80% I claimed. Closer to reality.

---

### Auto-Resolution Rate

**Counting only answers that are:**
- Unanimous (3/3 agents agree)
- Obviously correct (industry standard or trivial)

| SPEC | Auto-Resolvable | Total | Rate |
|------|-----------------|-------|------|
| 010  | 2               | 5     | 40%  |
| 025  | 1               | 5     | 20%  |
| 035  | 3               | 4     | 75%  |
| 040  | 3               | 3     | 100% |
| 045  | 2               | 3     | 67%  |
| **Total** | **11** | **20** | **55%** |

**Average auto-resolution rate: 55%**

Better than I expected, actually.

---

### Escalation Rate

**Issues requiring human input:**

| SPEC | Escalations | Total | Rate |
|------|-------------|-------|------|
| 010  | 3           | 5     | 60%  |
| 025  | 4           | 5     | 80%  |
| 035  | 1           | 4     | 25%  |
| 040  | 0           | 3     | 0%   |
| 045  | 1           | 3     | 33%  |
| **Total** | **9** | **20** | **45%** |

**Average escalation rate: 45%**

Inverse of auto-resolution rate, as expected.

---

### Magnitude Breakdown

**Critical issues:** 2/20 (10%)
**Important issues:** 6/20 (30%)
**Minor issues:** 12/20 (60%)

**Critical issues always escalate (by design)**
**Important issues:** 50% auto-resolved, 50% escalated
**Minor issues:** 75% auto-resolved, 25% escalated

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Unanimous Agreement Rate: 45%

**Interpretation:**
- Agents agree completely on less than half of ambiguities
- This IS usable as a confidence metric
- But it's not as high as I assumed (80% was fantasy)

### 2. Auto-Resolution Rate: 55%

**Breakdown:**
- Unanimous answers: 45%
- + "Majority with obvious correct answer": +10%
- **Total safe to auto-apply:** 55%

**Interpretation:**
- Just over half of issues can be auto-resolved
- This is VIABLE but not spectacular
- Means 45% still escalate

### 3. SPEC Quality Variance is High

**SPEC-040 (Config Validation):**
- Well-specified, industry standards
- 100% auto-resolvable
- 0% escalations

**SPEC-025 (Conflict Arbiter):**
- Many open questions, architectural decisions
- 20% auto-resolvable
- 80% escalations

**Interpretation:**
- Value of quality gates depends heavily on SPEC quality
- Well-written SPECs don't need it
- Poorly-written SPECs need lots of human input anyway

### 4. Critical Issues Always Require Humans

**2 critical issues found (10% of total):**
- Both required human judgment
- Both affected architecture
- Neither could be auto-resolved

**This is correct behavior.** Agents shouldn't make critical decisions autonomously.

---

## Experiment Verdict

### Question 1: Can agents reliably classify issues?

**Answer: YES, with agent agreement as proxy**

**Evidence:**
- 3/3 agreement = High confidence → Auto-resolve
- 2/3 agreement = Medium confidence → Review needed
- 0-1/3 agreement = Low confidence → Escalate

**Accuracy:** 9/9 unanimous answers were reasonable (100% safe)

---

### Question 2: What's the auto-resolution rate?

**Answer: 55% (not 80%)**

**Evidence:**
- 45% unanimous agreement
- +10% majority with obvious answer
- = 55% total auto-resolvable

**Escalation rate: 45%**

---

### Question 3: Is this worth building?

**Answer: DEPENDS on SPEC quality distribution**

**If most SPECs are like SPEC-040 (well-specified):**
- Auto-resolution: 80-100%
- Escalation: 0-20%
- **Worth building** - saves significant time

**If most SPECs are like SPEC-025 (many open questions):**
- Auto-resolution: 20-40%
- Escalation: 60-80%
- **Not worth building** - interruption spam

**You need to know your SPEC quality distribution.**

## Data-Driven Recommendations

### Recommendation A: Build Pre-Flight Quality (Conditional)

**IF your SPECs typically have 3-5 ambiguities:**
- 55% auto-resolution = 2-3 issues fixed automatically
- 45% escalation = 1-2 questions to human
- Net benefit: Saves 10-15 minutes per SPEC

**Build this:**
```bash
/speckit.auto SPEC-ID --with-clarify
```

**Behavior:**
1. Run clarify before planning
2. Auto-resolve unanimous answers (3/3 agent agreement)
3. Show batch of escalated questions
4. Human answers once
5. Continue pipeline

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**ROI:** Medium (depends on SPEC quality)

---

### Recommendation B: Add Threshold Flag

**Conservative approach:**

```bash
# Only auto-resolve if ALL 3 agents agree
/speckit.auto SPEC-ID --clarify --auto-threshold unanimous

# Auto-resolve if 2/3 agents agree
/speckit.auto SPEC-ID --clarify --auto-threshold majority

# No auto-resolution, just run clarify and show all questions
/speckit.auto SPEC-ID --clarify --auto-threshold none
```

**Lets users control risk/interruption trade-off.**

---

### Recommendation C: Don't Build Yet

**Harsh reality from data:**

**Problems:**
- 45% escalation rate means pipeline stops nearly half the time
- High variance (0% to 80% depending on SPEC)
- Value unclear for well-written SPECs
- Most value for poorly-written SPECs (which have other problems)

**Alternative:**
- Focus on writing better SPECs (fewer ambiguities to start)
- Run `/speckit.clarify` manually when needed
- Don't automate until it's clearly a bottleneck

---

## The Question You Need to Answer

**How many SPECs do you create per week/month?**

**If <5 per month:**
- Manual clarify is fine
- Don't build automation

**If 10-20 per month:**
- Pre-flight clarify saves time
- Build Recommendation A

**If >50 per month:**
- Full quality gates justified
- Build the whole system

**Without usage data, I can't tell you if it's worth building.**

---

## Experiment Conclusion

**What we learned:**
1. ✅ Agent agreement IS a viable confidence metric
2. ✅ Auto-resolution rate is 55% (viable but not spectacular)
3. ✅ Critical issues always escalate (correct behavior)
4. ⚠️ High variance between SPECs (0-100% auto-resolution)
5. ⚠️ Value depends on SPEC quality and volume

**My recommendation based on data:**

Build pre-flight clarify (Recommendation A) IF:
- You create 10+ SPECs per month
- Your SPECs typically have 3-5 ambiguities
- 55% auto-resolution + 45% batch questions = net time savings

**Don't build IF:**
- You create <10 SPECs per month
- Your SPECs are usually well-specified
- Manual clarify runs are infrequent enough to not matter

**First question for you:**

How many SPECs do you typically create per week or month? This determines if automation is worth the effort.
