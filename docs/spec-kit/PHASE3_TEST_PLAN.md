### 3.2 Error Recovery Across Modules (15 tests)

**Focus**: Error propagation, cleanup, retry coordination

| Test ID | Scenario | Error Type | Recovery Path |
|---------|----------|------------|---------------|
| E01 | Consensus failure → Handler retry → Evidence cleanup → State reset | Consensus empty | Retry with enhanced prompt |
| E02 | MCP failure → Fallback to file → Evidence records fallback → Retry succeeds | MCP timeout | File-based fallback |
| E03 | Guardrail schema violation → Handler error → State rollback → User notification | Invalid JSON | Schema enforcement |
| E04 | Evidence write failure → Handler retry → Lock cleanup → Success on retry | I/O error | Lock cleanup + retry |
| E05 | Agent timeout → Handler detects → Consensus retry → Evidence updated | Agent timeout | Timeout detection |
| E06 | Empty consensus → Handler retry → Enhanced prompt → Success | Empty result | AR-3 retry logic |
| E07 | Invalid JSON → Parser error → Handler retry with schema → Success | Parse error | AR-4 schema injection |
| E08 | State corruption → Evidence read fails → Fallback to default → Recovery | Corrupted state | Default state fallback |
| E09 | Multiple retries exhausted → Handler halts → Evidence logs failure → User escalation | Retry limit | Graceful halt |
| E10 | Quality gate failure → State preserved → Manual intervention → Resume | Quality failure | State preservation |
| E11 | Concurrent write conflict → Lock timeout → Retry with backoff → Success | Lock contention | Exponential backoff |
| E12 | Guardrail timeout → Handler continues → Warning logged → Evidence marked incomplete | Guardrail timeout | Continue with warning |
| E13 | MCP server crash → Reconnect → Replay → Success | MCP crash | Reconnection logic |
| E14 | Evidence disk full → Handler error → Cleanup old files → Retry | Disk full | Automatic cleanup |
| E15 | Network partition → MCP unreachable → Graceful degradation → Recovery | Network partition | Degraded mode |

### 3.3 State Persistence Integration (10 tests)

**Focus**: State ↔ Evidence synchronization

| Test ID | Scenario | Validation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| S01 | State change → Evidence write → Load from disk → State reconstructed correctly | State equality after reload |
| S02 | Pipeline interrupt → State saved → Resume → Continue from exact checkpoint | Exact checkpoint restoration |
| S03 | Multiple state updates → All persisted → Load latest → Correct state | Latest state loaded |
| S04 | State with quality outcomes → Persisted → Loaded → Outcomes intact | Quality outcomes preserved |
| S05 | State with retry count → Evidence recorded → Load → Retry limit enforced | Retry count preserved |
| S06 | Stage completion → Evidence updated → State advances → Reflected on reload | Stage index correct |
| S07 | Rollback → Evidence reverted → State restored → Previous checkpoint | Previous checkpoint restored |
| S08 | Concurrent state reads → Evidence locking → Consistent view | No race conditions |
| S09 | State migration (schema change) → Evidence adapts → Load succeeds | Schema evolution support |
| S10 | State audit trail → All transitions recorded → Evidence timeline complete | Complete audit trail |

### 3.4 Quality Gate Full Flow (10 tests)

**Focus**: Quality gates integrated with consensus, evidence, state

| Test ID | Scenario | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|

| Q02 | Critical issue → User escalation → Modal displayed → Resolution recorded → State updated | User resolved |
| Q03 | Multiple issues → Batched validation → Mixed outcomes → Evidence segregated | Batched processing |
| Q04 | Quality checkpoint → Consensus conflicts → Arbiter invoked → Resolution → Evidence | Arbiter resolution |
| Q05 | Auto-resolution failure → Escalation → User input → Applied → Pipeline continues | Escalation fallback |
| Q06 | Quality gate timeout → Default action → Evidence warns → Pipeline continues | Timeout handling |
| Q07 | Empty quality results → Skipped validation → Evidence notes skip → Success | Skip documented |
| Q08 | Quality modifications → Applied to artifacts → Evidence records changes → Validated | Modifications applied |
| Q09 | Multiple checkpoints → All outcomes tracked → Evidence comprehensive → Summary generated | All tracked |
| Q10 | Quality gates disabled → Bypassed validation → Evidence notes bypass → Warning issued | Bypass documented |

### 3.5 Concurrent Module Operations (10 tests)

**Focus**: Parallel execution, synchronization, locking

| Test ID | Scenario | Concurrency Validation |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| C01 | Parallel agent spawns → Concurrent consensus → Evidence locks → Sequential writes → All succeed | No data corruption |
| C02 | Multiple stages → Overlapping evidence writes → Locking prevents corruption | Lock effectiveness |

## 4. Testing Infrastructure Requirements

### 4.1 Existing Tools (Reuse)

- ✅ `MockSpecKitContext` - Handler testing without ChatWidget
- ✅ `MockMcpManager` - MCP response mocking
- ✅ `FilesystemEvidence` - Evidence I/O with tempdir
- ✅ `tempfile::TempDir` - Isolated test directories
- ✅ Fixture library - Real consensus artifacts

### 4.2 New Tools Needed

1. **Integration Test Harness** (`tests/common/integration_harness.rs`):
   - Orchestrates multi-module test setup
   - Provides pre-configured contexts
   - Handles cleanup

2. **State Builder** (`tests/common/state_builder.rs`):
   - Fluent API for test state construction
   - Example: `StateBuilder::new().stage(Plan).with_quality().build()`

3. **Evidence Verifier** (`tests/common/evidence_verifier.rs`):
   - Assertions for evidence file structure
   - Schema validation helpers
   - Timestamp verification

## 6. Success Criteria

**Phase 3 Complete When**:
- ✅ All 60 integration tests passing (441 → 501 tests)
- ✅ 100% pass rate maintained
- ✅ Coverage: 30-35% → 38-42% (target: 40%)
- ✅ Cross-module workflows verified
- ✅ Error recovery paths tested
- ✅ State persistence validated
- ✅ Documentation updated

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours (accelerated from 4-week plan)
**Target Completion**: 2025-10-19 (today, aggressive but achievable)

## 7. Risk Mitigation

**Risks**:
1. Test complexity → Start simple, iterate
2. Async coordination → Use controlled mocks
3. File I/O flakiness → Use tempdir cleanup
4. Long execution time → Parallelize where safe

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simplest scenarios (W01, E01, S01, Q01, C01)
- Build complexity incrementally
- Use existing test patterns from Phase 2
- Monitor test execution time

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Create integration test harness** (`tests/common/integration_harness.rs`)
2. **Implement W01-W05** (first 5 workflow tests)
3. **Verify passing** (441 → 446 tests, all green)
4. **Continue through scenarios** in order
5. **Measure coverage improvement** after each batch

**Ready to Begin Implementation** ✅
