# Quality Gates Configuration

**Status:** Production Ready
**Requires:** OpenAI API key for GPT-5 validation

---

## Environment Variables

### Required for GPT-5 Validation

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Without API key:**
- Quality gates will fail when 2/3 majority issues are encountered
- Only unanimous (3/3) issues will be auto-resolved
- Auto-resolution rate drops from 60% to 45%

### Optional

```bash
# Disable quality gates entirely
export SPEC_KIT_QUALITY_GATES_DISABLED=1

# Or run without quality gates
/speckit.auto SPEC-ID --no-quality-gates  # (not yet implemented)
```

---

## Usage

### With Quality Gates (Default)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
/speckit.auto SPEC-KIT-065
```

**Expected behavior:**
- 3 quality checkpoints run (pre-planning, post-plan, post-tasks)
- ~55% auto-resolved (unanimous)
- ~5-10% GPT-5 validated (2/3 majority)
- ~40% escalated to human
- ~40 minutes added to pipeline
- Git commit created with all quality modifications

### Performance

**Per checkpoint:**
- Agent execution: 8-10 min (clarify/checklist/analyze)
- GPT-5 validations: 2-5 sec per issue, ~10-15 sec total
- File modifications: <1 sec
- **Total per checkpoint:** ~8-11 min

**3 checkpoints:** ~24-33 min total added

---

## Costs

### API Costs (Estimated)

**Per pipeline with quality gates:**
- 4 quality gates Ã— 3 agents Ã— ~$0.10 = ~$1.20
- GPT-5 validations: 2-3 calls Ã— ~$0.50 = ~$1.00-1.50
- **Total quality gates:** ~$2.20-2.70 per pipeline

**Full pipeline:**
- Regular stages: ~$11
- Quality gates: ~$2.50
- **Total:** ~$13.50 per SPEC

**At 30 SPECs/month:**
- Regular: $330/month
- Quality gates: $75/month
- **Total:** ~$405/month

**ROI:** Saves ~13.5 hours/month, pays for itself if your time is >$30/hour.

## Telemetry

Quality gate telemetry stored in:
```
docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/consensus/
  â””â”€â”€ SPEC-ID/
      â”œâ”€â”€ quality-gate-pre-planning_TIMESTAMP.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ quality-gate-post-plan_TIMESTAMP.json
      â””â”€â”€ quality-gate-post-tasks_TIMESTAMP.json
```

**Schema v1.1:**
```json
{
  "command": "quality-gate",
  "specId": "SPEC-KIT-065",
  "checkpoint": "pre-planning",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T20:00:00Z",
  "schemaVersion": "v1.1",
  "gates": ["clarify", "checklist"],
  "summary": {
    "total_issues": 7,
    "auto_resolved": 4,
    "escalated": 3
  },
  "auto_resolved_details": [...],
  "escalated_details": [...]
}
```

## Git Commits

Quality gate modifications committed at pipeline end:

```
quality-gates: auto-resolved 12 issues, 5 human-answered

Checkpoint: pre-planning
- clarify: 3 auto-resolved, 2 human-answered
- checklist: 2 auto-improved, 0 escalated

Checkpoint: post-plan
- analyze: 2 auto-fixed, 1 human-answered

Checkpoint: post-tasks
- analyze: 1 auto-fixed, 0 escalated

Files modified:
- spec.md
- plan.md
- tasks.md

Telemetry: quality-gate-*_SPEC-KIT-065.json

## Troubleshooting

### GPT-5 Validation Fails

**Error:** "OPENAI_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** Export API key in environment before running

**Error:** "GPT-5 API call failed"
**Solutions:**
- Check API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Check OpenAI API status
- Verify billing is active

**Fallback:** Quality gates will escalate all 2/3 majority issues if GPT-5 fails

### Quality Gate Hangs

**Symptom:** Pipeline stuck at "Waiting for quality gate agents"
**Cause:** Agents failed to complete
**Solution:** Check agent logs, retry pipeline

### Too Many Escalations

**Symptom:** Every checkpoint has 5+ questions
**Cause:** SPEC is poorly specified
**Solution:** Improve SPEC quality before running automation, or disable quality gates for this SPEC

---

## Tuning

### Adjust Auto-Resolution Threshold

Currently:
- Unanimous (3/3) â†’ Auto-resolve
- Majority (2/3) â†’ GPT-5 validate â†’ Auto-resolve or escalate
- No consensus (0-1/3) â†’ Escalate

**To be more aggressive** (auto-resolve more, interrupt less):
- Modify `should_auto_resolve()` in quality.rs
- Allow medium confidence + important magnitude

**To be more conservative** (safer, more interruptions):
- Only auto-resolve high confidence + minor magnitude
- Escalate everything else

### Modify GPT-5 Prompt

Edit `build_gpt5_validation_prompt()` in handler.rs to:
- Add more context
- Change validation criteria
- Adjust temperature (currently 0.3)

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Auto-resolution rate** - Should be 55-60%
2. **False positive rate** - Auto-resolutions that were wrong (<5% target)
3. **Escalation quality** - % of escalations that were actually critical (>90% target)
4. **Time added** - Should be ~40 min per pipeline
5. **Cost per SPEC** - Should be ~$2.50 for quality gates

### How to Measure

Check telemetry files:
```bash
jq '.summary' docs/SPEC-OPS-004-.../quality-gate-*.json
```

Review git commits:
```bash
git log --grep="quality-gates" --oneline
```

---

## Disabling Quality Gates

### Temporarily

Set flag before running:
```bash
SPEC_KIT_QUALITY_GATES_DISABLED=1 /speckit.auto SPEC-ID
```

### Permanently

Modify `SpecAutoState::with_quality_gates()` in state.rs:
```rust
pub fn new(...) -> Self {
    Self::with_quality_gates(..., false)  // Disable by default
}
```
