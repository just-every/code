# TUI ChatWidget Refactor Plan

This document tracks the refactor of `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget.rs` into smaller, maintainable modules and state bundles. It also captures what has been completed, and what remains so another engineer can continue seamlessly.

## Goals

- Break the 389kB `chatwidget.rs` into cohesive modules by responsibility.
- Group related state into small structs to reduce field sprawl and accidental misuse.
- Centralize common history operations (push/replace/remove) behind a tiny API.
- Keep behavior identical and builds green at every step (`./build-fast.sh`).
- Maintain zero warnings policy.

---

## Status Summary (as of this commit)

Completed extractions (modules):
- `chatwidget/perf.rs`: `PerfStats` (data + helpers)
- `chatwidget/diff_ui.rs`: `DiffOverlay`, `DiffBlock`, `DiffConfirm`
- `chatwidget/message.rs`: `UserMessage`, `create_initial_user_message`
- `chatwidget/streaming.rs`: streaming deltas and finalize helpers (`on_commit_tick`, `is_write_cycle_active`, `handle_streaming_delta`, `finalize_active_stream`)
- `chatwidget/exec_tools.rs`: exec lifecycle, tool merge helpers; move-before-assistant helpers
- `chatwidget/tools.rs`: Web Search and MCP tool lifecycle
- `chatwidget/layout_scroll.rs`: HUD toggles, layout_areas, PageUp/PageDown, mouse wheel scroll
- `chatwidget/diff_handlers.rs`: all Diff overlay key handling

State groupings:
- `StreamState` on `ChatWidget`
  - `current_kind`, `closed_answer_ids`, `closed_reasoning_ids`, `next_seq`, `seq_answer_final`, `drop_streaming`
- `LayoutState` on `ChatWidget`
  - `scroll_offset`, `last_max_scroll`, `last_history_viewport_height`, `vertical_scrollbar_state`, `scrollbar_visible_until`, `last_hud_present`, `browser_hud_expanded`, `agents_hud_expanded`, `last_frame_height`
- `DiffsState` on `ChatWidget`
  - `session_patch_sets`, `baseline_file_contents`, `overlay`, `confirm`, `body_visible_rows`
- `PerfState` on `ChatWidget`
  - `enabled`, `stats: RefCell<PerfStats>` replacing `perf_enabled` and `perf`

History helper shim:
- Added to `ChatWidget`:
  - `history_push(cell)`: wrapper for `add_to_history`
  
Additional references:
- Renderer cache bridge rationale: [`history_render_cache_bridge.md`](history_render_cache_bridge.md)
- History record schema + snapshot details: [`history_state_schema.md`](history_state_schema.md)
- Migrated usages in `exec_tools.rs` and `tools.rs` (some hotspots) to use the shim.

Build + policy:
- All steps validated with `./build-fast.sh`.
- Zero compiler warnings kept intact.

## New File/Module Map

- `tui/src/chatwidget.rs` (shrinking coordinator)
  - owns `ChatWidget` and wires events → submodules
  - houses grouped states: `StreamState`, `LayoutState`, `DiffsState`, `PerfState`
  - history helper shim (temporary; see Future consolidation)
- `tui/src/chatwidget/perf.rs` → performance structs
- `tui/src/chatwidget/diff_ui.rs` → diff overlay data types
- `tui/src/chatwidget/message.rs` → user message building
- `tui/src/chatwidget/streaming.rs` → unified streaming operations
- `tui/src/chatwidget/exec_tools.rs` → exec lifecycle + merges
- `tui/src/chatwidget/tools.rs` → Web Search + MCP lifecycle
- `tui/src/chatwidget/layout_scroll.rs` → layout + scrolling + HUD controls
- `tui/src/chatwidget/diff_handlers.rs` → diff overlay key handling

---

## Behavior-Preserving Changes Made

- No intentional UX/logic changes. Extracted code calls the same operations as before.
- Replaced direct field access with grouped state access (e.g., `self.stream_state.current_kind`).
- Centralized common history mutations and used them in a few hotspots to reduce duplication.

---

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1) Finish History helper adoption — DONE
- Replaced remaining ad-hoc `history_cells[idx] = …`, `remove(i)`, and `add_to_history` sites with `history_replace_at`, `history_remove_at`, `history_push` (kept direct remove+insert only for move-before-assistant helpers where the removed cell is reused).
- Swept: `chatwidget.rs`, `chatwidget/tools.rs`, `chatwidget/exec_tools.rs`, `chatwidget/interrupts.rs`.

2) History merge API consolidation — DONE
- Added `history_push_and_maybe_merge`, `history_replace_and_maybe_merge`, and `history_maybe_merge_tool_with_previous` on `ChatWidget`.
- Adopted across exec completion and web search completion paths; explicit merge code removed from call sites.

3) Enum-ize exec actions and newtype IDs — DONE
- Added `ExecAction` enum + `action_enum_from_parsed()` and adopted across `history_cell`, `exec_tools`, and `chatwidget`.
- Introduced ID newtypes: `ExecCallId`, `ToolCallId`, `StreamId`; migrated state maps/sets and call sites.
- Removed legacy `action_from_parsed` helper.

4) Streaming API cleanup — DONE
- In `streaming.rs`, added `begin(kind,id)`, `delta_text(kind,id,text)`, `finalize(kind, follow_bottom)` facades.
- Replaced direct `current_kind` mutations at call sites with the facade; kept internal control inside streaming module.

5) Tests (valuable quick wins)
- Unit tests
  - Exec merges: combinations for Read/Search/List/Run and exit statuses.
  - Parse/paste: `[image: …]`, `[file: …]`, direct path handling, size thresholds, non‑UTF8 case.
  - Diff selection math: selecting block by offset and generating undo/explain prompts.
- Replay tests (vt100)
  - Cancel mid-stream (drop deltas immediately, then finalize when backend completes).
  - “Final answer closes lingering tools/execs” (already coded; test it). 

6) Optional: rename for clarity
- Consider `ChatWidget` → `ChatView` (render/controller) once responsibilities are clearer.

## Tips for the Next Engineer

- Always validate with `./build-fast.sh`; warnings are treated as failures.
- Avoid touching any code related to `CODEX_SANDBOX_*` env vars.
- Keep steps small and behavior‑preserving; prefer many tiny commits over one big one.
- When moving code, first copy the function into a submodule, compile, then replace the original with a delegate call. Only then remove the original body.
- For scrolling math: all offsets are measured from the bottom; `LayoutState` centralizes the values you need.
- For diffs popup: `DiffsState` now owns overlay/confirm and the session patch context.
- For perf: read/write via `self.perf_state.enabled` and `self.perf_state.stats.borrow_mut()`.

## Quick Pointers

- Stream state: `StreamState` on `ChatWidget` (search for `stream_state`)
- Layout state: `LayoutState` on `ChatWidget` (search for `layout.`)
- Diff state: `DiffsState` on `ChatWidget` (search for `diffs.`)
- History helpers: `history_push`, `history_replace_at`, `history_remove_at` in `chatwidget.rs`
- Web search lifecycle: `chatwidget/tools.rs`
- Exec lifecycle + merges: `chatwidget/exec_tools.rs`
- Streaming functions: `chatwidget/streaming.rs`
- Diff overlay keys: `chatwidget/diff_handlers.rs`
- HUD/layout: `chatwidget/layout_scroll.rs`

## Done Checklist

- [x] Extract perf/diff/message data types
- [x] Extract streaming and exec/tool handlers
- [x] Extract layout/scroll + diff key handling
- [x] Group StreamState, LayoutState, DiffsState, PerfState
- [x] Add history helper shim and adopt in hotspots
- [x] Keep builds green with zero warnings at each step

## Todo Checklist

- [x] Sweep remaining history mutations to use the shim
- [x] Consolidate history merge API (adopt helpers across call sites)
- [x] Replace all action string checks with `ExecAction`
- [x] Add ID newtypes (Exec/Tool/Stream) and migrate maps
- [x] Tighten streaming API (begin/delta/finalize facade)
- [x] Add state-driven renderer/unit tests for exec, assistant, streaming, diff

## How to Validate Locally

```bash
./build-fast.sh
```

Expect: success with zero warnings. The script builds the Rust workspace in a fast profile and maintains symlinks required by the CLI wrapper.

If anything is unclear or you hit conflicts, start by grepping for the state bundle or module name and follow the delegate calls from `ChatWidget` into the submodule.
