      "Validate telemetry spec-validate_2025-10-13T04:07:33Z-2021418142.json exists but recorded scenario status as 'skipped' because policy checks were stubbed and HAL remained in mock mode.",
      "Sample comparison and hal.summary verification remain outstanding; documentation should explicitly call out placeholder diff and plan for a non-stubbed rerun.",

      "Agent sandboxes could not locate telemetry due to untracked fixture context; local workspace confirmed file presence and captured summary manually.",
