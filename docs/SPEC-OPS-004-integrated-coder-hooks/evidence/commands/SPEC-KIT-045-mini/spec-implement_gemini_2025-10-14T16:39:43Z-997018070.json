  "edge_cases": [
    "Telemetry JSON uses stubbed policy fields; downstream tools must tolerate status=\"skipped\" while overrides remain active.",
    "Mini bundle stays under 100 KB; scripts consuming fixture-size logs should handle timestamped filenames.",
    "Roster JSON intentionally stores agent metadata without tokens/cost; consumers must not assume those keys exist."
