# Slash Commands

Codex CLI supports a set of slash commands you can type at the start of the
composer input. These commands provide quick actions, toggles, or expand into
full prompts. This document lists all built‑in commands and what they do.

Notes

- Commands are shown in the TUI’s slash popup; the order below matches the UI.
- Commands marked “prompt‑expanding” transform your input into a full prompt and
  typically kick off multi‑agent flows.
- Some commands accept arguments; if required, usage is shown in parentheses.

## Navigation & Session

- `/browser`: open internal browser.
- `/chrome`: connect to Chrome.
- `/new`: start a new chat during a conversation.
- `/resume`: resume a past session for this folder.
- `/quit`: exit Codex.
- `/logout`: log out of Codex.
- `/login`: manage Code sign-ins (select, add, or disconnect accounts).

## Workspace & Git

- `/init`: create an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for Codex.
- `/diff`: show `git diff` (including untracked files).
- `/undo`: open a snapshot picker so you can restore workspace files to a
  previous Code snapshot and optionally rewind the conversation to that point.
- `/branch [task]`: create a worktree branch and switch to it. If a
  task/description is provided, it is used when naming the branch. Must be run
  from the repository root (not inside another branch worktree).
- `/merge`: merge the current worktree branch back into the default branch and
  remove the worktree. Run this from inside the worktree created by `/branch`.
- `/review [focus]`: without arguments, opens a review picker so you can audit
  the workspace, a specific commit, compare against another branch, or enter
  custom instructions. With a focus argument, skips the picker and uses your
  text directly.
- `/cmd <name>`: run a project command defined for the current workspace.

## Spec Ops Guardrails & Telemetry

- `/spec-ops-plan <SPEC-ID> [--baseline-mode <full|no-run|skip>] [other options]`: Run the baseline audit + guardrail prep for a SPEC task. Telemetry now emits `schemaVersion`, `baseline.mode`, `baseline.artifact`, `baseline.status`, `hooks.session.start`, and an `artifacts` array. The legacy `/spec-plan` alias remains temporarily and shows a deprecation warning.
- `/spec-ops-tasks <SPEC-ID> [options]`: Prepare Spec Ops task automation hooks. Telemetry payload includes `tool.status` plus log artifacts.
- `/spec-ops-implement <SPEC-ID> [options]`: Lock SPEC.md and prime guardrails ahead of implementation. Telemetry emits `lock_status`, `hook_status`, and artifacts.
- `/spec-ops-validate <SPEC-ID> [--scenario <name>]`: Execute validation harness scenarios and record telemetry with `scenarios[{name,status}]` and log artifacts.
- `/spec-ops-audit <SPEC-ID> [--dry-run]`: Run the Spec Ops audit scenarios; telemetry mirrors Validate stage (`scenarios` array). `/spec-audit` performs the multi-agent consensus review and records verdict JSON for `/spec-auto` gating.
- `/spec-ops-unlock <SPEC-ID> [--spec-path <path>]`: Force-unlock SPEC.md after the guardrail workflow completes. Telemetry emits `unlock_status` and artifacts. Alias `/spec-unlock` is deprecated.
- `/spec-auto <SPEC-ID> [goal] [--from <stage>]`: Orchestrate the end-to-end Spec Ops + multi-agent pipeline, preparing guardrail commands, stage prompts, and consensus checks (supports stages: plan, tasks, implement, validate, audit, unlock). Guardrail telemetry must validate against schema v1 before the pipeline advances.
- HAL HTTP MCP: configure using `docs/hal/hal_config.toml` and `docs/hal/hal_profile.json`, then run `code mcp call hal <request>` (health/list_movies/indexer_test/graphql_ping) to capture evidence for SPEC-KIT-018.

## UX & Display

- `/theme`: switch between color themes.
- `/verbosity (high|medium|low)`: change text verbosity.
- `/model`: choose what model and reasoning effort to use.
- `/reasoning (minimal|low|medium|high)`: change reasoning effort.
- `/prompts`: show example prompts.
- `/status`: show current session configuration and token usage.
- `/limits`: visualize current hourly and weekly rate-limit usage.
- `/update`: check the installed version, detect available upgrades, and run the
  appropriate installer when possible.
- `/mcp`: manage MCP servers (status/on/off/add).
- `/validation [status|on|off|<tool> (on|off)]`: inspect or toggle validation
  harness settings.

## Search & Mentions

- `/mention`: mention a file (opens the file search for quick insertion).

## Performance & Agents

- `/perf (on|off|show|reset)`: performance tracing controls.
- `/agents`: list agents (running and availability).
- `/pro [on|off|toggle|status|auto (on|off|toggle|status)]`: manage Pro mode,
  including autonomous follow-ups and observer status (available in dev,
  dev-fast, and pref builds).

## Prompt‑Expanding (Multi‑Agent)

These commands expand into full prompts (generated by `codex-core`) and
typically start multiple agents. They require a task/problem description.

- `/plan <task>`: create a comprehensive plan (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/solve <problem>`: solve a challenging problem (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/code <task>`: perform a coding task (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/spec-plan <SPEC-ID> <goal>`: Spec-aware planning consensus; injects Gemini/Claude/GPT prompts referencing local-memory context. Agent responses must include `model`, `model_release`, and `reasoning_mode` metadata (see `docs/spec-kit/model-strategy.md`).
- `/spec-tasks <SPEC-ID>`: Multi-agent task synthesis aligned with SPEC.md tracking; emits consensus artifacts referencing telemetry evidence.
- `/spec-implement <SPEC-ID> [summary]`: Implementation strategy prompts; agents embed model metadata and reference guardrail telemetry.
- `/spec-validate <SPEC-ID>`: Validation consensus prompts tied to Spec Ops telemetry; degraded runs require re-running guardrail stages.
- `/spec-audit <SPEC-ID>`: Go/no-go audit consensus prompts coordinating all agents; persists verdict JSON with model metadata.
- `/spec-unlock <SPEC-ID>`: Unlock justification prompts prior to running `/spec-ops-unlock`; includes model metadata in consensus notes.

## Development‑Only

- `/demo`: populate the chat history with assorted sample cells (available in
  dev and perf builds for UI testing).
- `/test-approval`: test approval request (available in debug builds only).

Implementation Notes

- The authoritative list of commands is defined in
  `codex-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs` (the `SlashCommand` enum). When adding a
  new command, please update this document to keep the UI and docs in sync.
- Prompt formatting for `/plan`, `/solve`, and `/code` lives in
  `codex-rs/core/src/slash_commands.rs`.
