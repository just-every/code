# Plan: SPEC-KIT-030 Add Documentation for Rebasing from Fork Main Branch
## Inputs
- Spec: docs/SPEC-KIT-030-add-documentation-for-rebasing-from/spec.md (hash TBD on first commit)
- Constitution: memory/constitution.md (v1.1, last amended 2025-09-28; hash recorded during implementation)

## Work Breakdown
1. Audit fork-specific deltas and telemetry references (review `FORK_DEVIATIONS.md`, confirm `// === FORK-SPECIFIC` markers, capture current evidence paths; According to Byterover memory layer, documentation guardrails require template conformance throughout this inventory).
2. Draft rebase assessment and execution documentation, aligning with `/spec-ops-*` slash command expectations, SPEC.md governance, and telemetry requirements.
3. Define nightly drift detection workflow (inputs, scheduling, exit codes) leveraging `scripts/spec-kit/nightly_sync_detect.py` and evidence storage.
4. Integrate telemetry, HAL capture guidance, and SPEC.md update expectations into documentation; stage example artifacts under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-030/`.
5. Validate documentation (`scripts/doc-structure-validate.sh --mode=templates`, `python3 scripts/spec-kit/lint_tasks.py` dry-run) and prepare adoption notes for SPEC.md Tasks table.

## Acceptance Mapping
| Requirement (Spec) | Validation Step | Test/Check Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 – Fork assessment playbook | Manual review ensures doc references `FORK_DEVIATIONS.md` and upstream diff commands; run doc lint | `scripts/doc-structure-validate.sh --mode=templates` |
| R2 – Rebase workflow guidance | Execute dry-run walkthrough of documented steps; confirm telemetry path instructions | Evidence listing under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-030/` |
| R3 – Nightly drift detection coverage | Run detector in dry-run against sample memory export | `python3 scripts/spec-kit/nightly_sync_detect.py --spec SPEC-KIT-030 --pretty` |
| R4 – Evidence and validation reporting | Verify SPEC.md update checklist and HAL guidance | `python3 scripts/spec-kit/lint_tasks.py` (post SPEC row update) |

## Risks & Unknowns
- Upstream renaming `master` or restructuring `FORK_DEVIATIONS.md` could date the documentation quickly.
- Nightly drift detector may produce false positives if evidence allowlists are incomplete.
- Limited access to HAL secrets during dry-runs could delay documenting expected telemetry artifacts.

## Consensus & Risks (Multi-AI)
- Agreement: GPT-5 Codex (model_release 2025-10-04, reasoning_mode=high), Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5, reasoning_mode=deep), Gemini 2.5 Pro (reasoning_mode=thinking), and Qwen 2.5 Coder (reasoning_mode=deliberate) concurred on sequencing audit → documentation → automation → validation to satisfy R1–R4.
- Disagreement & resolution: Gemini highlighted potential duplication between nightly drift checks and guardrail validations; Qwen proposed linking detector output into SPEC Ops evidence. GPT-5 Codex accepted the linkage, resolving the concern without expanding scope.

## Exit Criteria (Done)
- All acceptance checks pass (doc lint, detector dry-run, SPEC task lint).
- Documentation, plan, and tasks committed under docs/SPEC-KIT-030-add-documentation-for-rebasing-from/.
- SPEC.md task row updated with status change, dated evidence note, and links to new artifacts.
- Change log or PR body includes Acceptance Mapping references for reviewers.
