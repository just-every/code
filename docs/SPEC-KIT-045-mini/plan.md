# Plan: SPEC-KIT-045-mini
## Inputs
- Spec: docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/spec.md (sha256 6bcce50a1b5bf14ab8834ef26301fc597538902a0f5eff9db3768022dea79cc3 captured 2025-10-14)
- Constitution: memory/constitution.md (v1.1, sha256 08cc5374d2fedec0b1fb6429656e7fd930948d76de582facb88fd1435b82b515)

## Work Breakdown
1. Reload constitution, product-requirements.md, PLANNING.md, SPEC.md row T49, and docs/spec-kit/prompts.json (spec-plan v20251002-plan-a) to reconfirm scope, acceptance criteria, and roster expectations for the 2025-10-14 run.
2. Inspect `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/spec-plan_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z-79323873.{json,log}` and `baseline_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z-79323873.md`, extract four-agent roster metadata, and persist `roster_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.json` alongside the guardrail artefacts.
3. Author `jq` assertions covering `command`, `specId`, `sessionId`, `timestamp`, `schemaVersion`, and `baseline.*` fields for the 15:58:30Z telemetry, storing results in `docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/telemetry/plan-schema-check_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.txt` for downstream validation.
4. Document HAL mock rehearsal steps: `SPEC_OPS_TELEMETRY_HAL=1 /cmd spec-ops-validate SPEC-KIT-045-mini --hal mock`, capture hal.summary rationale, and prep a sorted diff versus `docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/telemetry/sample-validate.json`.
5. Refresh docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/{plan.md,tasks.md,unlock-notes.md,checksums.sha256} and SPEC.md row T49 with the 2025-10-14 evidence references, noting any `SPEC_OPS_POLICY_*_CMD=true` usage and scheduling a clean rerun without overrides.
6. Record consensus synthesis for this stage under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/consensus/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/spec-plan_synthesis.json`, capturing agreements, resolved conflicts, and supporting artefact hashes.

## Acceptance Mapping
| Requirement (Spec) | Validation Step | Test/Check Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1: `/guardrail.plan` records four-agent roster | Review 2025-10-14 guardrail log/JSON and export `roster_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.json` | docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/spec-plan_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z-79323873.{json,log}; roster_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.json |
| R2: HAL mock telemetry matches schema v1 with documented rationale | Run jq assertions and capture HAL mock diff for 15:58:30Z preparation | docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/telemetry/plan-schema-check_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.txt; docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/telemetry/mock-hal_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.diff |
| R3: Fixture docs cite evidence and rerun guidance | Ensure plan/tasks/unlock + checksums reference 2025-10-14 files and rerun commands | docs/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/{plan.md,tasks.md,unlock-notes.md,checksums.sha256}; SPEC.md row T49 notes |

## Risks & Unknowns
- Roster summary for 2025-10-14 is not yet stored; extraction must precede /tasks to avoid stale evidence.
- Policy override shortcuts (`SPEC_OPS_POLICY_*_CMD=true`) were required to bypass unavailable policy runners; follow-up clean rerun is mandatory before unlock.
- HAL live mode remains untested; schema drift or credential gaps may surface when real endpoints replace the mock.

## Consensus & Risks (Multi-AI)
- Agreement: All agents aligned on anchoring documentation to the 2025-10-14T15:58:30Z telemetry set, documenting mock HAL schema checks, and embedding precise rerun commands plus evidence filenames in plan/tasks/unlock notes.
- Disagreement & resolution: Agents differed on whether to refresh tasks.md immediately; resolved by updating plan guidance now and scheduling the concrete tasks.md rewrite during the /tasks stage while flagging the dependency here.

## Exit Criteria (Done)
- Telemetry artefacts `spec-plan_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z-79323873.{json,log}`, `baseline_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z-79323873.md`, `roster_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.json`, `plan-schema-check_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.txt`, and `mock-hal_2025-10-14T15:58:30Z.diff` exist and are referenced.
- plan.md, tasks.md, unlock-notes.md, checksums.sha256, and SPEC.md row T49 cite the 2025-10-14 evidence set and rerun instructions, with policy override posture recorded.
- Consensus synthesis for the plan stage is stored under docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/consensus/SPEC-KIT-045-mini/ with agreements/conflict resolution.
