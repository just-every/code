## @just-every/code v0.5.10

Another small maintenance release that keeps the CLI aligned with the latest package metadata and maintains security coverage in CI.

### Changes
- CLI: bump the npm package metadata to 0.5.10 so installs pick up the latest build.
- CI: add a Ruby-free CodeQL workflow to keep security scanning enabled without extra dependencies.

### Install
```
npm install -g @just-every/code@latest
code
```
