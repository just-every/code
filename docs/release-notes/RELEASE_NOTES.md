## @just-every/code v0.6.42

Focused polish for image handling in the TUI.

### Changes
- TUI/Images: persist pasted or dropped images from temp locations into session storage so they stay available when sending.
- TUI/Composer: keep image placeholders verbatim when building messages so inline markers align with attachments.

### Install
```
npm install -g @just-every/code@latest
code
```
