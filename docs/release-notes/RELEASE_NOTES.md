## @just-every/code v0.5.9
Every Code 0.5.9 focuses on sturdier automation defaults, safer compaction, and refreshed guidance for the rebrand.

### Changes
- Auto Drive: prefer codex max by default for ChatGPT automation so complex runs start with maximum capacity.
- Agents: run code-family agents with the currently installed binary to eliminate version drift mid-execution.
- Compaction: add an emergency fallback when trimming exceeds budget so long sessions keep progressing.
- Docs: ship refreshed Auto Drive, agents, settings, and CLI guides aligned with the Every Code rebrand.

### Install
```
npm install -g @just-every/code@latest
code
