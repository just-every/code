## @just-every/code v0.5.13
A maintenance refresh that keeps installs aligned with the latest binaries while ensuring CI stays green during the workflow transition.

### Changes
- CLI: bump the npm package and platform binaries to 0.5.13 so installs grab the latest build.
- CI: add a placeholder rust-ci workflow so required checks stay green during migration.

### Install
```
npm install -g @just-every/code@latest
code
```
