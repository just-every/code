# Audit: SPEC-KIT-DEMO Guardrail Baseline (T26)

## Summary
- Stage executed 2025-10-12 using `spec-audit_2025-10-12T16:24:23Z-43914755.json` with `SPEC_OPS_HAL_SKIP=1` still in effect.
- Guardrail scripts, policy layers, and evidence capture remain functional; automation still relies on manual consensus evidence from 2025-10-05.
- Audit verdict: **Conditional Pass** — infrastructure is sound, but outstanding follow-ups prevent completion of T26.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Guardrail telemetry: `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-DEMO/spec-audit_2025-10-12T16:24:23Z-43914755.json`
- Validate telemetry (skip recorded): `spec-validate_2025-10-12T15:19:43Z-1223811711.json`
- Command + consensus footprints: `scripts/spec_ops_004/evidence_stats.sh --spec SPEC-KIT-DEMO` → 22 MB command, 204 KB consensus, 29 JSON artifacts.
- Documentation: `docs/SPEC-KIT-DEMO/{spec.md,plan.md,tasks.md}`, `SPEC.md` row T26, `docs/spec-kit/model-strategy.md`, `docs/spec-kit/prompts.json`.
- Consensus bundle reference: `spec-plan_2025-10-05T04:31:14Z_{gemini,claude,gpt_pro,synthesis}.json` and matching telemetry.

## Findings
- ✅ Docs and tracker aligned after 2025-10-12 updates; SPEC.md row T26 cites refreshed telemetry set.
- ✅ Guardrail policy checks (prefilter & final) continue to pass.
- ⚠️ HAL validation skipped due to missing `HAL_SECRET_KAVEDARR_API_KEY`; skip recorded but rerun required.
- ⚠️ No fresh consensus bundle since 2025-10-05; halt screenshot still missing.
- ✅ `python3 scripts/spec-kit/lint_tasks.py` rerun 2025-10-12 (`lint_tasks_2025-10-12T17-22-21Z.txt`).
- ⚠️ Consensus artifacts remain stubs from manual run; multi-agent automation not yet proven.

## Required Follow-Ups
1. Provision HAL credentials or document definitive skip (`SPEC_OPS_HAL_SKIP=1`) in plan/tasks + rerun validate when ready.
2. Capture halt gating screenshot alongside new consensus bundle (`/spec-plan --consensus-exec SPEC-KIT-DEMO`).
3. Persist new consensus per-agent JSON + synthesis for 2025-10-12 run (current directory only holds 2025-10-05 bundle).

## Compliance Flags
- HAL skip documented but treated as degradation; unlock blocked until rerun captured.
- Lint and screenshot evidence mandatory before T26 can progress to Done.
- Model lineup degraded (Gemini/Claude/Codex only); `gpt_pro` and `gpt_codex` endpoints still unavailable.

## Notes
- Evidence footprint remains below 25 MB soft limit; continue monitoring with `evidence_stats.sh`.
- SPEC.md notes updated 2025-10-12 to include plan/tasks/implement/validate telemetry; audit telemetry should be added upon unlock.
