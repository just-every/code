fix(core/chat): surface DNS/network guidance on stream errors (#377)

- detect reqwest connect/timeout failures while starting model streams and wrap them with actionable hints
- add DNS-specific guidance so users can spot resolver misconfigurations (e.g., empty /etc/resolv.conf)
- cover hint detection with lightweight unit tests
