# Session Handoff: Architecture Improvements (2025-10-18)

**Session Duration**: ~9 hours
**Commits**: 2 (29 commits ahead of upstream)
**Branch**: main
**Status**: Clean working tree

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Completed Tasks (6/13, 7.5 hours)

**P0 Critical** (Commit: 15a8be3d8):
1. ✅ ARCH-001: Fixed upstream documentation (just-every/code lineage)
2. ✅ ARCH-002: Added MCP fallback (5.3x faster, auto-degradation)
3. ✅ ARCH-003: Documented config precedence + validator
4. ✅ ARCH-004: Deleted deprecated subprocess code (-180 LOC)

**P1 High Priority** (Commit: dad5372ad):
5. ✅ ARCH-006: Centralized agent naming (SpecAgent enum)
6. ✅ ARCH-007: Added evidence locking (fs2 exclusive locks)

### Documentation Created (2,700+ lines)
- `REVIEW.md` (1,017 lines): Architecture analysis
- `ARCHITECTURE-TASKS.md` (857 lines): 13 tasks
- `MEMORY-POLICY.md` (145 lines): Local-memory only policy
- `AGENTS.md` (570 lines): Spec-kit agent reference
- `ARCH-INSPECTION-FINDINGS.md`: Deep task validation

### Test/Validation
- Tests: 135 unit + 3 integration passing
- Benchmark: 5.3x MCP speedup validated
- Performance: 8.7ms consensus checks (vs 46ms subprocess)

## Deep Inspection Findings

**Ran systematic validation** of all 13 architecture tasks.

**Found 3 False/Overstated Issues**:
1. **ARCH-008**: Protocol extension - enables nothing real (SKIP)
2. **ARCH-009**: Agent coordination - misdiagnosed orthogonal layers (REFOCUS to constant extraction)
3. **ARCH-010**: State migration - no non-TUI clients exist (SKIP)

**Validated 4 Real Issues**:
1. **ARCH-005**: Dual MCP - real but low impact (downgrade to P2)
2. **ARCH-011**: Async TUI - needs validation spike
3. **ARCH-012**: Upstream contributions - community value
4. **ARCH-013/014**: Correctly deferred

**Review Quality**: Good architectural vision, but didn't validate problems cause actual failures

---

## Revised Roadmap (Next Session)

### Immediate (11-22h real value)
1. **ARCH-009-REVISED**: Extract retry constants (30min)
   - Simple DRY fix: MAX_AGENT_RETRIES defined 3x
   - Quick win, no dependencies

2. **ARCH-011**: Async TUI research spike (4-8h)
   - Research: Can Ratatui event loop be async?
   - Measure: Is 8.7ms blocking actually a problem? (likely not - 12x below 100ms threshold)
   - Decision: Migrate or document why current acceptable
   - Deliverable: `docs/async-tui-research.md` with go/no-go

3. **ARCH-012**: Upstream contributions (6-12h)
   - Extract MCP retry logic (2h)
   - Generalize native dashboard (3-4h)
   - Optional: Evidence repository pattern (4-6h)
   - Target: github.com/just-every/code

### Optional Cleanup (2-3h)
4. **ARCH-005**: Eliminate dual MCP (downgraded from P1)
   - Remove TUI MCP spawn, use core's manager instead
   - Saves process overhead (currently 7 local-memory processes running)
   - Low impact - resource waste, not functional issue

### Skip (Saves 26-34h)
- ❌ ARCH-008: Protocol extension (no use case)
- ❌ ARCH-010: State migration (YAGNI - no clients exist)
- ❌ ARCH-009 (original formulation)

## Current Architecture State

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Native MCP integration (5.3x faster, validated)
- ✅ Automatic fallback to file evidence (resilient)
- ✅ Config precedence documented and validated
- ✅ Type-safe agent naming (compile-time checks)
- ✅ Concurrent write protection (file locks)
- ✅ Upstream lineage clear (just-every/code)
- ✅ Memory policy enforced (local-memory only)

**Known Limitations** (documented, accepted):
- Dual MCP spawn (resource waste, 2-3h to fix if desired)
- Spec-auto state in TUI (no non-TUI clients need it)
- 8.7ms blocking during consensus (12x below perception threshold)
- Shell scripts (POSIX-dependent, works fine on Mac/Linux)

**Unresolved** (worth investigating):
- Async TUI benefits unclear (spike needed)
- Upstream contribution process unknown (check just-every/code guidelines)

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate** (can start now):
1. ARCH-009-REVISED: 30 minutes, zero dependencies, quick win
2. ARCH-011: 4-8h research spike (ratatui-async viability)

**After Spike**:
- If async TUI worthwhile → design migration
- If blocking OK → document rationale, close task

**Community**:
3. ARCH-012: Extract contributable code, submit PRs to just-every/code

**Total Expected Effort**: 11-21h for remaining valuable work
