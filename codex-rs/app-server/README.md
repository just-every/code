# Thread removal

`thread/archive` and `thread/delete` reject attempts to remove a live internal
worker with JSON-RPC error `-32600`. The worker's owner controls its shutdown.
For example, a Guardian reviewer remains available to its parent conversation
after a client tries to archive or delete it.

After the owner releases the worker, its saved conversation can be archived or
deleted normally. Ordinary client-controlled threads keep their existing behavior.
