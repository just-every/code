# Strategic Model Assignment Analysis

## The Core Architecture: Research → Synthesize → Arbiter

**This pattern is sound** for complex specification work:

1. **Research (Gemini)** - Broad context gathering, tool use, retrieval
2. **Synthesize (Claude)** - Transform research into structured deliverables
3. **Arbiter (GPT)** - Final reasoning, conflict resolution, consensus

**The logic checks out:**
- Separation of concerns reduces individual prompt complexity
- Each model optimizes for its strength
- Sequential flow allows later stages to critique earlier ones

## Specific Model Choices - Where I Actually See Issues

### ✅ **Claude for Synthesis - Correct**
- Claude 4.5 Sonnet excels at structured output, code generation, following complex format requirements
- Good choice for plan.md, tasks.md generation where format compliance matters
- Strong at prose + code hybrid documents

### ⚠️ **Gemini for Research - Questionable**
Your rationale: "breadth + tool use"

**Counter-argument:** Claude 3.5/4.5 also has excellent tool use. What specific research tasks does Gemini do better?

**If you're using Gemini primarily for:**
- Large context ingestion → Valid, Gemini has 2M context window
- Web search/retrieval → Valid if using Search Grounding
- Broad ideation → Debatable, Claude is also good here

**If you're using it because "we need a different model for diversity"** → weak rationale

**Better question:** For spec-plan stage, what specific research tasks benefit from Gemini over having Claude do research + synthesis?

### ⚠️ **GPT as Universal Arbiter - Worth Reconsidering**

You're using GPT-5 with `--reasoning high` for final arbitration across ALL stages.

**Potential issue:**
- Validate/Audit stages need technical precision (test results, code citations)
- Is GPT better at this than Claude examining Claude's own output?

**Alternative consideration:**
```yaml
Technical stages (implement/validate):
  Arbiter: Same model as synthesizer (Claude knows its own output)

Strategic stages (plan/audit):
  Arbiter: Different model (GPT provides outside perspective)
```

### ❌ **Guardrails Using Different Models - Problematic**

You synthesize with Claude, then validate with GPT-Codex → GPT.

**Problem:**
- Guardrails check output format/schema compliance
- The model that generated output knows its own format best
- Cross-model guardrails add latency and potential false positives

**Recommendation:**
Use the **synthesis model** (Claude) for guardrail checks, or use lightweight JSON schema validation without LLM calls.

## The Cost/Complexity Question

You're running **5 model calls per stage:**
```
Gemini (research)
→ Claude (synthesize)
→ GPT (arbiter)
→ GPT-Codex (guardrail prefilter)
→ GPT (guardrail final)
```

**Valid if:**
- Each model call adds measurable quality
- You've measured disagreement rates and found consensus catches real errors
- The cost is acceptable for your use case

**Invalid if:**
- You haven't run end-to-end tests to measure quality delta
- You're doing it because "more models = better" without evidence

**My actual question:** Have you run comparative tests showing 5-model produces better specs than 2-model or 1-model?

## Escalation Strategy - Actually Good

```yaml
Default: Normal reasoning
Conflict: --reasoning high
Budget exhausted: Fallback models
```

This is sensible **IF** you have telemetry showing:
- Conflict rate (how often do models disagree?)
- Escalation success rate (does --reasoning high resolve conflicts?)
- Cost impact (how often do you pay for escalation?)

## What I'd Actually Validate

1. **Gemini's necessity:** Run 3 SPECs with Claude doing research+synthesis, measure quality delta vs. Gemini→Claude pipeline

2. **Arbiter value:** Run 3 SPECs where Claude self-critiques vs. GPT arbitrates, measure error catch rate

3. **Guardrail approach:** Run schema validation vs. LLM guardrails, measure false positive rate and cost

4. **Consensus value:** Run 5 SPECs with full consensus, 5 with single-model, blind review quality scores

## My Revised Recommendation

**The architecture is defensible** - multi-model consensus for high-stakes specification work makes sense.

**The specific assignments are 80% good:**
- ✅ Claude for synthesis
- ✅ Sequential flow with specialization
- ⚠️ Gemini for research (justify with specific use cases)
- ⚠️ GPT for all arbitration (consider stage-specific arbiters)
- ❌ Different models for guardrails (use synthesis model or pure validation)

**The missing piece: Telemetry**

You need metrics on:
- Agreement/disagreement rates between models
- Which stages benefit most from multi-model consensus
- Cost per SPEC vs. quality improvement
- Common failure modes that consensus catches vs. single-model misses

**Bottom line:** Your model strategy is thoughtful and **probably** good, but unproven. The right choice depends on empirical data you don't have yet. Start with the full pipeline, measure everything, then optimize based on where multi-model adds the most value.

## Specific Recommendations

### Immediate Changes

**1. Guardrail Simplification**
```diff
Current: GPT-Codex (prefilter) → GPT (policy)
Recommended: Claude (same as synthesis) OR pure JSON schema validation
```

**2. Stage-Specific Arbiter Strategy**
```yaml
Plan/Audit stages:
  Research: Gemini
  Synthesize: Claude
  Arbiter: GPT (outside perspective valuable)

Implement/Validate stages:
  Research: Gemini
  Synthesize: Claude
  Arbiter: Claude (self-critique, knows own output)
```

### Validation Experiments

**Experiment 1: Single vs Multi-Model**
- Pick 3 representative SPECs
- Run each with: (a) Claude-only, (b) Full 3-model consensus
- Blind review both outputs for quality
- Measure cost and time for each

**Experiment 2: Gemini Necessity**
- Run spec-plan with: (a) Gemini research → Claude synthesis, (b) Claude research + synthesis
- Compare quality of research artifacts
- Measure if Gemini's 2M context window provides value

**Experiment 3: Arbiter Value**
- Run spec-implement with: (a) Claude self-critique, (b) GPT arbitration
- Count error detection rate for each approach
- Measure if cross-model arbitration catches bugs single-model misses

### Telemetry to Add

```yaml
Per-stage metrics:
  - model_disagreement_rate: float
  - arbiter_override_count: int
  - escalation_triggered: bool
  - reasoning_mode_used: str
  - total_cost_usd: float
  - quality_score: float (manual or automated)

Per-SPEC metrics:
  - total_model_calls: int
  - consensus_conflicts: int
  - retry_count: int
  - end_to_end_cost: float
  - time_to_complete: duration
```

## Long-Term Strategy

**Phase 1: Baseline (Current)**
- Run full 5-model pipeline on 5-10 SPECs
- Collect comprehensive telemetry
- Establish quality baseline with manual review

**Phase 2: Optimization (Next)**
- Identify which stages benefit most from multi-model
- Simplify stages where single-model performs equally well
- Optimize cost without sacrificing quality

**Phase 3: Adaptive (Future)**
- Dynamic model selection based on SPEC complexity
- Automatic escalation only when telemetry shows benefit
- Cost-aware routing (use expensive models only when needed)

## Open Questions to Answer

1. **What percentage of arbiter calls actually override the synthesizer?** If <5%, arbiter may be unnecessary overhead.

2. **How often do Gemini and Claude disagree on research findings?** If rarely, one model may suffice.

3. **What types of errors does cross-model consensus catch that single-model misses?** Categorize to understand value.

4. **Is the 2M context window of Gemini actually utilized?** Check token usage to see if you need it.

5. **Do guardrail LLM calls catch errors that JSON schema validation wouldn't?** Measure false positive rate.

---

**Summary:** Your model strategy shows sophisticated thinking about role specialization. The concerns are about empirical validation, not architectural soundness. Run experiments, collect data, optimize based on evidence.
